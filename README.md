# Opticar: robotic base platform

The Opticar is a robotic demonstration vehicle for wide-angle surround stereoskopic depth measurement. The base platform uses ROS for Mecanum kinematics and sensor data fusion/visualization.

This repository documents how to setup a Raspberry Pi 3 as the main ROS node.

The opticar demonstrator was created during the Opticar project, funded by the Central Innovation Programme for SMEs (ZIM) of the German Ministry for Economy and Energy (BMWi). The ROS implementation on the vehicle was based on the work of the [Linorobot suite](https://linorobot.org/).
